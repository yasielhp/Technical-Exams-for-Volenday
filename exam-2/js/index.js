//Write a function calcAvgHeight which calculates average person height. The function takes only one argument, which is an object whose properties are instances of a person class created with the following function:

function Person(h, w) {
  this.height = h;
  this.weight = w;
}

//Given an object data, return the calculated average height. If there are no persons in the data object, return null and console the output.

/**
For example, the following call should return (174+190)/2=182:

calcAvgHeight({
  Matt: { height: 174, weight: 69 },
  Jason: { height: 190, weight: 103 }
});
*/

function calcAvgHeight(data) {
  // Calculate average height from received data. If no data, return null.
